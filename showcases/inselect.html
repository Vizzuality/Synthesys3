              <h2>About the Project</h2>
              <p>Whilst imaging a whole drawer of specimens is relatively quick, manually segmenting
                the specimens is a time consuming process. Inselect was developed to address this
                problem – it can crop individual images of specimens from whole-drawer scans and
                similar images that are generated through digitisation of museum collections.</p>
              <p>Inselect combines image processing, barcode reading, validation of user-defined
                metadata and batch processing to offer a high level of automation that can greatly
                increase the efficiency of digitisation workflows.</p>
              <p>Once the draw is scanned and processed through Inselect, a segmented image is
                provided which gives the user the option to resize, move, create or delete
                segmentation areas. The metadata for each specimen can then be manually modified and
                entered by the user.</p>

                                             href="https://www.idigbio.org/">iDigBio</a> on the 29th
                March 2016 to provide a software overview and discuss how it might be integrated
                into institutional workflows. This is now accessible via <a

              <h2>Development</h2>
              <p>Inselect was developed by a team at the Natural History Museum, in collaboration
                with scientists from Stellenbosch University in South Africa. A workshop was held in
                September 2014 to develop a specification and prototype, which was then presented at
                the Taxonomic Database Working Group (TDWG) meeting in October 2014. The program was
                subsequently developed for wider release and testing amongst SYNTHESYS3 Taxonomic
                Access Facilities (TAFs) and has undergone continuous development and improvement
                based on feedback from user communities.
